# Requirements

- A system running on either
  - GNU/Linux
  - Windows 10 64bit: Pro, Enterprise or Education (Build 15063 or later)
  - macOS Sierra 10.12 or newer on a hardware from at least 2010
  - If your system does not match any of the requirements above, you must install a virtual machine.
[This tutorial](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-Ubuntu-on-VirtualBox) may help you.

- Docker
    - Instructions to install Docker are available [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- Docker Compose
    - Instructions to install Docker Compose are available [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose).
- A web browser is also needed to display the visualizations generated by symfinder. The visualization has been tested using:
  - Google Chrome (provides the best experience in terms of fluidity)
  - Mozilla Firefox
  - Safari
  - Microsoft Edge
- If you want to obtain symfinder through its Git repository, you also need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.


**Note:** By default, on a GNU/Linux host, Docker commands must be run using `sudo`. Two options are available for you in order to run symfinder:
- Follow [these short steps](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user) to allow your user to call Docker commands,
- Preface the scripts calls with `sudo`.
